The [classname]#PasswordField# is a variant of [classname]#TextField# that hides
the typed input from visual inspection.


[source, java]
----
PasswordField tf = new PasswordField("Keep it secret");

The result is shown in <<figure.components.passwordfield.basic>>.

You should note that the [classname]#PasswordField# hides the input only from
"over the shoulder" visual observation. Unless the server connection is
encrypted with a secure connection, such as HTTPS, the input is transmitted in
clear text and may be intercepted by anyone with low-level access to the
network. Also phishing attacks that intercept the input in the browser may be
possible by exploiting JavaScript execution security holes in the browser.

The [classname]#PasswordField# does not have its own CSS style name but uses the
same [literal]#++v-textfield++# style as the regular [classname]#TextField#. See
<<components-textfield#components.textfield.css,"CSS Style Rules">> for information on styling it.
