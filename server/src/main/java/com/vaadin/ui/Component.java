/**
 * {@code Component} is the top-level interface that is and must be implemented
 * by all Vaadin components. {@code Component} is paired with
 * {@link AbstractComponent}, which provides a default implementation for all
 * the methods defined in this interface.
 *
 * <p>
 * Components are laid out in the user interface hierarchically. The layout is
 * managed by layout components, or more generally by components that implement
 * the {@link ComponentContainer} interface. Such a container is the
 * <i>parent</i> of the contained components.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getParent()} method allows retrieving the parent component of a
 * component. While there is a {@link #setParent(HasComponents)}, you rarely
 * need it as you normally add components with the
 * {@link ComponentContainer#addComponent(Component) addComponent()} method of
 * the layout or other {@code ComponentContainer}, which automatically sets the
 * parent.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A component becomes <i>attached</i> to an application (and the
 * {@link #attach()} is called) when it or one of its parents is attached to the
 * main window of the application through its containment hierarchy.
