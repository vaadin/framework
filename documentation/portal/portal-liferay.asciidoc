= Developing Vaadin Portlets for Liferay

*_This section has not yet been updated for Vaadin Framework 8._*

A Vaadin portlet requires resources such as the server-side Vaadin libraries, a
theme, and a widget set. You have two basic ways to deploy these: either
globally in Liferay, so that the resources are shared between all Vaadin
portlets, or as self-contained WARs, where each portlet carries their own
resources.

The self-contained way is easier and more flexible to start with, as the
different portlets may have different versions of the resources. Currently, the
latest Maven archetypes support the self-contained portlets, while with portlets
created with the Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse only support globally deployed
resources.

Using shared resources is more efficient when you have multiple Vaadin portlets
on the same page, as they can share the common resources. However, they must use
exactly same Vaadin version. This is recommended for production environments,
where you can even serve the theme and widget set from a front-end server. You
can install the shared resources as described in <<portal.liferay.install>>.

At the time of writing, the latest Liferay release 6.2 is bundled with a version
of Vaadin release 6. If you want to use Vaadin 7 portlets with shared resources,
you first need to remove the old ones as described in <<portal.liferay.remove>>.

[[portal.liferay.profile]]
== Defining Liferay Profile for Maven

When creating a Liferay portlet project with a Maven archetype or the Liferay
IDE, you need to define a Liferay profile. With the Liferay IDE, you can create
it when you create the project, as described in <<portal.liferay.ide>>, but for
creating a project from the Maven archetype, you need to define in manually.

[[portal.liferay.profile.settings]]
=== Defining Profile in [filename]#settings.xml#

Liferay profile can be defined either in the user or in the global
[filename]#settings.xml# file for Maven. The global settings file is located in
[filename]#${MAVEN_HOME}/conf/settings.xml# and the user settings file in
[filename]#${USER_HOME}/.m2/settings.xml#. To create a user settings file, copy
at least the relevant headers and root element from the global settings file.

    &lt;/liferay.app.server.deploy.dir&gt;
    &lt;liferay.app.server.lib.global.dir&gt;**${liferay.tomcat.dir}/lib/ext**
    &lt;/liferay.app.server.lib.global.dir&gt;
    &lt;liferay.app.server.portal.dir&gt;**${liferay.tomcat.dir}/webapps/ROOT**
    &lt;/liferay.app.server.portal.dir&gt;
  &lt;/properties&gt;     
&lt;/profile&gt;
----
The parameters are as follows:

liferayinstall:: Full (absolute) path to the Liferay installation directory.
liferay.version:: Liferay version by the Maven version numbering scheme. The first two (major and minor) numbers are same as in the installation package. The third (maintenance) number starts from 0 with first GA (general availability) release.
liferay.maven.plugin.version:: This is usually the same as the Liferay version.
liferay.auto.deploy.dir:: The Liferay auto-deployment directory. It is by default [filename]#deploy# under the Liferay installation path.
liferay.tomcat.version(optional):: If using Tomcat, its version number.
liferay.tomcat.dir:: Full (absolute) path to Tomcat installation directory. For Tomcat bundled with Liferay, this is under the Liferay installation directory.
liferay.app.server.deploy.dir:: Directory where portlets are deployed in the application server used for Liferay. This depends on the server - for Tomcat it is the [filename]#webapps# directory under the Tomcat installation directory.
liferay.app.server.lib.global.dir:: Library path where libraries globally accessible in the application server should be installed.
liferay.app.server.portal.dir:: Deployment directory for static resources served by the application server, under the root path of the server.


If you modify the settings after the project is created, you need to touch the
POM file in the project to have the settings reloaded.


[[portal.liferay.profile.properties]]
=== Activating the Maven Profile

The Maven 2 Plugin for Eclipse (m2e) must know which Maven profiles you use in a
project. This is configured in the [menuchoice]#Maven# section of the project
properties. In the [guilabel]#Active Maven Profiles# field, enter the profile ID
defined in the [filename]#settings.xml# file, as illustrated in
<<figure.portal.liferay.profile.properties>>.

[[portal.liferay.project]]
== Creating a Portlet Project with Maven

Creation of Vaadin a Maven project is described in
<<dummy/../../../framework/getting-started/getting-started-maven#getting-started.maven,"Using
Vaadin with Maven">>. For a Liferay project, you should use the
[literal]#++vaadin-archetype-liferay-portlet++#.

[[portal.liferay.project.archetype-parameters]]
=== Archetype Parameters

The archetype has a number of parameters. If you use Maven Plugin for Eclipse
(m2e) to create the project, you get to enter the parameters after selecting the
archetype, as shown in <<figure.portal.liferay.project.archetype-parameters>>.

Minimally, you just need to enter the artifact ID. To activate the Maven profile
created as described earlier in <<portal.liferay.profile>>, you need to specify
the profile in the [guilabel]#Profiles# field under the [guilabel]#Advanced#
section.

.Liferay Project Archetype Parameters
image::img/liferay-maven-project.png[]

The other parameters are the following:

vaadinVersion:: Vaadin release version for the Maven dependency.
uiClassName:: Class name of the UI class stub to be created.
theme:: Theme to use. You can use either a project theme, which must be compiled before deployment, or use one of the default themes.
portletTitle:: Title shown in the portlet title bar.
portletShortTitle:: Title shown in contexts where a shorter title is preferred.
portletKeywords:: Keywords for finding the portlet in Liferay.
portletDescription:: A description of the portlet.
portletName:: Identifier for the portlet, used for identifying it in the configuration files.
portletDisplayName:: Name of the portlet for contexts where it is displayed.




[[portal.liferay.ide]]
== Creating a Portlet Project in Liferay IDE

Liferay IDE, which you install in Eclipse as plugins just like the Vaadin
plugin, enables a development environment for Liferay portlets. Liferay IDE
allows integrated deployment of portlets to Liferay, just like you would deploy
servlets to a server in Eclipse. The project creation wizard supports creation
of Vaadin portlets.


Loading widget sets, themes, and the Vaadin JAR from a portlet is possible as
long as you have a single portlet, but causes a problem if you have multiple
portlets. To solve this, Vaadin portlets need to use a globally installed widget
set, theme, and Vaadin libraries.

__Liferay 6.2, which is the latest Liferay version at the time of publication of
this book, comes bundled with an older Vaadin 6 version. If you want to use
Vaadin 7, you need to remove the bundled version and install the newer one
manually as described in this chapter.__

In these instructions, we assume that you use Liferay bundled with Apache
Tomcat, although you can use almost any other application server with Liferay
just as well. The Tomcat installation is included in the Liferay installation
package, under the [filename]#tomcat-x.x.x# directory.

[[portal.liferay.remove]]
== Removing the Bundled Installation

Before installing a new Vaadin version, you need to remove the version bundled
with Liferay. You need to remove the Vaadin library JAR from the library
directory of the portal and the [filename]#VAADIN# directory from under the root
context. For example, with Liferay bundled with Tomcat, they are usually located
as follows:

* [filename]#tomcat-x.x.x/webapps/ROOT/html/VAADIN#
* [filename]#tomcat-x.x.x/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/vaadin.jar#


[[portal.liferay.install]]
== Installing Vaadin Resources

To use common resources needed by multiple Vaadin portlets, you can install them
globally as shared resources as described in the following.

If you are installing Vaadin in a Liferay version that comes bundled with an
older version of Vaadin, you first need to remove the resources as described in
<<portal.liferay.remove>>.

In the following, we assume that you use only the built-in "reindeer" theme in
Vaadin and the default widget set.

. Get the Vaadin installation package from the Vaadin download page
. Extract the following Vaadin JARs from the installation package: [filename]#vaadin-server.jar# and [filename]#vaadin-shared.jar#, as well as the [filename]#vaadin-shared-deps.jar# and [filename]#jsoup.jar# dependencies from the [filename]#lib# folder
. Rename the JAR files as they were listed above, without the version number
. Put the libraries in [filename]#tomcat-x.x.x/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/#
. Extract the [filename]#VAADIN# folders from [filename]#vaadin-server.jar#,
[filename]#vaadin-themes.jar#, and [filename]#vaadin-client-compiled.jar# and
copy their contents to [filename]#tomcat-x.x.x/webapps/ROOT/html/VAADIN#.

You need to define the widget set, the theme, and the JAR in the
[filename]#portal-ext.properties# configuration file for Liferay, as described
earlier. The file should normally be placed in the Liferay installation
directory. See Liferay documentation for details on the configuration file.

Below is an example of a [filename]#portal-ext.properties# file:


----
# Path under which the VAADIN directory is located.
# (/html is the default so it is not needed.)
# vaadin.resources.path=/html

# Portal-wide widget set
vaadin.widgetset=com.vaadin.server.DefaultWidgetSet

# Theme to use
# This is the default theme if nothing is specified
vaadin.theme=reindeer
----

The allowed parameters are:

[parameter]#vaadin.resources.path#:: Specifies the resource root path under the portal context. This is
[filename]#/html# by default. Its actual location depends on the portal and the
application server; in Liferay with Tomcat it would be located at
[filename]#webapps/ROOT/html# under the Tomcat installation directory.

[parameter]#vaadin.widgetset#:: The widget set class to use. Give the full path to the class name in the dot
notation. If the parameter is not given, the default widget set is used.

[parameter]#vaadin.theme#:: Name of the theme to use. If the parameter is not given, the default theme is
used, which is [literal]#++reindeer++#.



You will need to restart Liferay after creating or modifying the
[filename]#portal-ext.properties# file.
