Once you have installed a development environment, as described in the previous chapter, creating a Vaadin Framework project proceeds in the IDE that you have chosen.

The Vaadin Framework core library and all Vaadin add-ons are available through Maven, a commonly used build and dependency management system.

The recommended way to create a Vaadin application project is to use a Maven archetype.
The archetypes contain all the needed dependencies, which Maven takes care of.

In this chapter, we:

* Give an overview of the Vaadin Framework libraries
* List the available Maven archetypes
* Give step-by-step instructions for creating a project in the Eclipse IDE, NetBeans IDE, and IntelliJ IDEA, as well as with command-line.
