This is a test project to verify the basic functionality of various related plugins and addons.

To validate a given Vaadin Version, run `mvn clean verify -Dvaadin.version=VERSIONNUMBER`

Note that `mvn clean install` needs to be executed in the top-level test project or in the widget-set-testutil subproject before running tests for any individual submodule.
