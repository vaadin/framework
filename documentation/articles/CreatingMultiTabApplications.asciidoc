= Creating multi-tab applications

Every new request to the server gets a new session and UI instance.
Having the application open in separate tabs or windows means that the
instances are totally separate from each others, and thus won't conflict
and cause any out of sync or similar issues.

Opening the new tab will open the application into it's start page. Use
URI fragments if you want to open a specific view into the secondary
tab. You can read the URI fragments in the `UI.init()` and decide if you
want to show the main view or a specialized view:

[source,java]
....
public void init(VaadinRequest request) {
  String person = request.getParameter("editPerson");
  if (person == null) {
    setContent(new MainView());
  } else {
    setContent(new EditPersonView(person));
  }
}
....
