= Events and Listeners

Vaadin Framework offers an event-driven programming model for handling user interaction.
When a user does something in the user interface, such as clicks a button or
selects an item, the application needs to know about it. Many Java-based user
interface frameworks follow the __Event-Listener pattern__ (also known as the
Observer design pattern) to communicate user input to the application logic. So
does Vaadin Framework. The design pattern involves two kinds of elements: an object that
generates ("fires" or "emits") events and a number of listeners that listen for
the events. When such an event occurs, the object sends a notification about it
to all the listeners. In a typical case, there is only one listener.

Events can serve many kinds of purposes. In Vaadin Framework, the usual purpose of events
is handling user interaction in a user interface. Session management can require
special events, such as time-out, in which case the event would actually be the
lack of user interaction. Time-out is a special case of timed or scheduled
events, where an event occurs at a specific date and time or when a set time has
passed.

To receive events of a particular type, an application must register a listener
object with the event source. The listeners are registered in the components
with an [methodname]#add*Listener()# method (with a method name specific to the
listener).

Most components that have related events define their own event class and the
corresponding listener class. For example, the [classname]#Button# has
[classname]#Button.ClickEvent# events, which can be listened to through the
[classname]#Button.ClickListener# functional interface.

In the following, we assign a button click listener using a lambda expression.

final Button button = new Button("Push it!");

button.addClickListener(event ->
  button.setCaption("You pushed it!"));

<<figure.eventlistenerdiagram>> illustrates the case where an
application-specific class inherits the [classname]#Button.ClickListener#
interface to be able to listen for button click events. The application must
instantiate the listener class and register it with
[methodname]#addClickListener()#. When an event occurs, an event object is instantiated, in this case a
[classname]#Button.ClickEvent#. The event object knows the related UI component,
in this case the [classname]#Button#.
