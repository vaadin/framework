((("Google Web
Toolkit")))
This section provides an introduction to the various technologies and designs,
which Vaadin Framework is based on. This knowledge is not necessary for using Vaadin Framework, but
provides some background if you need to make low-level extensions to the framework.

[[architecture.technology.html]]
== HTML and JavaScript

((("HTML")))
((("JavaScript")))
The World Wide Web, with all its websites and most of the web applications, is
based on the use of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML defines the
structure and formatting of web pages, and allows inclusion of graphics and
other resources. It is based on a hierarchy of elements marked with start and
end tags, such as [literal]#++<div> ... </div>++#. Vaadin Framework uses HTML version 5,
although conservatively, to the extent supported by the major browsers, and
their currently most widely used versions.

((("DOM")))
JavaScript, on the other hand, is a programming language for embedding programs
in HTML pages. JavaScript programs can manipulate a HTML page through the
Document Object Model (DOM) of the page. They can also handle user interaction
events. The Client-Side Engine of the framework and its client-side widgets do exactly
this, although it is actually programmed in Java, which is compiled to
JavaScript with the Vaadin Client Compiler.

Vaadin Framework largely hides the use of HTML, allowing you to concentrate on the UI
component structure and logic. In server-side development, the UI is developed
in Java using UI components and rendered by the client-side engine as HTML, but
it is possible to use HTML templates for defining the layout, as well as HTML
formatting in many text elements. Also when developing client-side widgets and
UIs, the built-in widgets in the framework hide most of HTML DOM manipulation.


[[architecture.technology.styling]]
== Styling with CSS and Sass

((("CSS")))
((("Sass")))
While HTML defines the content and structure of a web page, __Cascading Style
Sheet__ (CSS) is a language for defining the visual style, such as colors, text
sizes, and margins. CSS is based on a set of rules that are matched with the
HTML structure by the browser. The properties defined in the rules determine the
visual appearance of the matching HTML elements.


[source, css]
----
/* Define the color of labels in my view */
.myview .v-label {
  color: blue;
}

((("SCSS")))
((("CSS3")))
__Sass__, or __Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets__, is an extension of the CSS
language, which allows the use of variables, nesting, and many other syntactic
features that make the use of CSS easier and clearer. Sass has two alternative
formats, SCSS, which is a superset of the syntax of CSS3, and an older indented
syntax, which is more concise. The Vaadin Sass compiler supports the SCSS
syntax.

((("themes")))
Vaadin Framework handles styling with __themes__ defined with CSS or Sass, and associated
images, fonts, and other resources. Vaadin themes are specifically written in
Sass. In development mode, Sass files are compiled automatically to CSS. For
production use, you compile the Sass files to CSS with the included compiler.
The use of themes is documented in detail in
<<dummy/../../../framework/themes/themes-overview.asciidoc#themes.overview,"Themes">>,
which also gives an introduction to CSS and Sass.


[[architecture.technology.ajax]]
== AJAX

((("AJAX")))
((("XML")))
((("JavaScript")))
((("HTML
5")))
((("CSS")))
((("DOM")))
((("XMLHttpRequest")))
AJAX, short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a technique for developing
web applications with responsive user interaction, similar to traditional
desktop applications. Conventional web applications, be they JavaScript-enabled
or not, can get new page content from the server only by loading an entire new
page. AJAX-enabled pages, on the other hand, handle the user interaction in
JavaScript, send a request to the server asynchronously (without reloading the
page), receive updated content in the response, and modify the page accordingly.
This way, only small parts of the page data need to be loaded. This goal is
archieved by the use of a certain set of technologies: HTML, CSS, DOM,
JavaScript, and the XMLHttpRequest API in JavaScript. XML is just one way to
serialize data between the client and the server, and in Vaadin it is serialized
with the more efficient JSON.

The asynchronous requests used in AJAX are made possible by the
[methodname]#XMLHttpRequest# class in JavaScript. The API feature is available
in all major browsers and is under way to become a W3C standard.

The communication of complex data between the browser and the server requires
some sort of __serialization__ (or __marshalling__) of data objects. The Vaadin
servlet and the client-side engine handle the serialization of shared state
objects from the server-side components to the client-side widgets, as well as
serialization of RPC calls between the widgets and the server-side components.


[[architecture.technology.gwt]]
== GWT

((("Google Web
Toolkit")))
The client-side of Vaadin Framework is based on GWT.
Its purpose is to make it possible to develop web user interfaces that run in
the browser easily with Java instead of JavaScript. Client-side modules are
developed with Java and compiled into JavaScript with the Vaadin Compiler, which
is an extension of the GWT Compiler. The client-side framework also hides much
of the HTML DOM manipulation and enables handling browser events in Java.

GWT is essentially a client-side technology, normally used to develop user
interface logic in the web browser. Pure client-side modules still need to
communicate with a server using RPC calls and by serializing any data. The
server-driven development mode in the framework effectively hides all the client-server
communications and allows handling user interaction logic in a server-side
application. This makes the architecture of an AJAX-based web application much
simpler. Nevertheless, Vaadin Framework also allows developing pure client-side
applications, as described in
<<dummy/../../../framework/clientsideapp/clientsideapp-overview.asciidoc#clientsideapp.overview,"Client-Side
Applications">>.

See
<<dummy/../../../framework/architecture/architecture-client-side#architecture.client-side,"Client-Side
Engine">> for a description of how the client-side framework based on GWT is
used in the Client-Side Engine of Vaadin Framework.
<<dummy/../../../framework/clientside/clientside-overview.asciidoc#clientside.overview,"Client-Side
Vaadin Development">> provides information about the client-side development,
and
<<dummy/../../../framework/gwt/gwt-overview.asciidoc#gwt.overview,"Integrating
with the Server-Side">> about the integration of client-side widgets with the
server-side components.


[[architecture.technology.servlet]]
== Java Servlets

A Java Servlet is a class that is executed in a Java web server (a __Servlet
container__) to extend the capabilities of the server. In practice, it is
normally a part of a __web application__, which can contain HTML pages to
provide static content, and JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlets to provide
dynamic content. This is illustrated in
<<figure.architecture.technology.servlet>>.

[[figure.architecture.technology.servlet]]
.Java Web Applications and Servlets
image::img/java-servlet.png[width=80%, scaledwidth=100%]

Web applications are usually packaged and deployed to a server as __WAR__ (
__Web application ARchive__) files, which are Java JAR packages, which in turn
are ZIP compressed packages. The web application is defined in a
deployment descriptor, which defines the servlet
classes and also the mappings from request URL paths to the servlets. 

The servlets are Java classes that handle HTTP requests passed to them by the
server through the __Java Servlet API__. They can generate HTML or other content
as a response. JSP pages, on the other hand, are HTML pages, which allow
including Java source code embedded in the pages. They are actually translated
to Java source files by the container and then compiled to servlets.

The UIs of server-side Vaadin applications run as servlets. They are wrapped
inside a [classname]#VaadinServlet# servlet class, which handles session
tracking and other tasks. On the initial request, it returns an HTML loader page
and then mostly JSON responses to synchronize the widgets and their server-side
counterparts. It also serves various resources, such as themes. The server-side
UIs are implemented as classes extending the [classname]#UI# class, as described
in
<<dummy/../../../framework/application/application-overview.asciidoc#application.overview,"Writing
a Server-Side Web Application">>. The class is given as a parameter to the
Vaadin Servlet in the deployment descriptor.

The Client-Side Engine of Vaadin Framework as well as any client-side extension are loaded to the browser as static JavaScript files.
The client-side engine, or widget set in technical terms, needs to be located under the [filename]#VAADIN/widgetsets# path in the web application.
It is normally automatically compiled to include the default widget set, as well as any installed add-ons and custom widgets.
