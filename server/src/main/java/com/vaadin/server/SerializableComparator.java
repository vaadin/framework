/**
 * A {@link Comparator} that is also {@link Serializable}.
 * <p>
 * You can create a serializable comparator from a regular comparator through a
 * method reference by appending <code>::compare</code>. For example
 * <code>SerializableComparator&lt;Employee&gt;
 * comparator = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getFirstName)::compare</code>.
 * The resulting comparator will in most cases cause exceptions if it is
 * actually being serialized, but this construct will enable using the
 * shorthands in {@link Comparator} in applications where session will not be
 * serialized.
