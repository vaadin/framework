 * Field components are built upon the framework defined in the Field interface

 * The Field interface inherits the {@link Component} superinterface and also
 * the {@link Property} interface to have a value for the field.

 *             7 {@code com.vaadin.ui.Field}. It is provided for compatibility
 *             and migration purposes. As of 8.0, new field components should
