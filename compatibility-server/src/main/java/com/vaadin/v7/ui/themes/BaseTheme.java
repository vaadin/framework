/**
 * <p>
 * The Base theme is the foundation for all Vaadin themes. Although it is not
 * necessary to use it as the starting point for all other themes, it is heavily
 * encouraged, since it abstracts and hides away many necessary style properties
 * that the Vaadin terminal expects and needs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When creating your own theme, either extend this class and specify the styles
 * implemented in your theme here, or extend some other theme that has a class
 * file specified (e.g. Reindeer or Runo).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All theme class files should follow the convention of specifying the theme
 * name as a string constant <code>THEME_NAME</code>.
 *
 * @since 6.3.0
 * @deprecated As of 8.0, no replacement available, only {@link ValoTheme} is supported.
