/**
 * The Audio component translates into an HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; element and as
 * such is only supported in browsers that support HTML5 media markup. Browsers
 * that do not support HTML5 display the text or HTML set by calling
 * {@link #setAltText(String)}.
 *
 * A flash-player fallback can be implemented by setting HTML content allowed (
 * {@link #setHtmlContentAllowed(boolean)} and calling
 * {@link #setAltText(String)} with the flash player markup. An example of flash
 * fallback can be found at the <a href=
 * "https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_audio_and_video_in_Firefox#Using_Flash"
 * >Mozilla Developer Network</a>.
 *
 * Multiple sources can be specified. Which of the sources is used is selected
 * by the browser depending on which file formats it supports. See
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video#Table">wikipedia</a> for a
 * table of formats supported by different browsers.
