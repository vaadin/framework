The [classname]#Button# component is normally used for initiating some action,
such as finalizing input in forms. When the user clicks a button, a
[classname]#Button.ClickEvent# is fired, which can be handled by adding a __click listener__
using either the [methodname]#onClick()# or the [methodname]#addClickListener()# method.

You can handle button clicks with an anonymous class as follows:


[source, java]
----
Button button = new Button("Do not press this button");

button.addClickListener(clickEvent ->
    Notification.show("Do not press this button again"));
----
See the http://demo.vaadin.com/book-examples-vaadin7/book#component.button.basic[on-line example, window="_blank"].

The listener can also be given in the constructor, which is often perhaps simpler.

The button component can be styled in many ways, as illustrated in <<figure.component.button.basic>>.

If you handle several buttons in the same listener, you can differentiate between
them by comparing the [classname]#Button# object reference returned by the [methodname]#getButton()#
method of [classname]#Button.ClickEvent# to a kept reference. For a detailed description 
of these patterns together with some examples, please see 
<<dummy/../../../framework/architecture/architecture-events#architecture.events,"Events and Listeners">>.

== CSS Style Rules


[source, css]
----
.v-button { }
  .v-button-wrap { }
    .v-button-caption { }
----

A button has an overall [literal]#++v-button++# style. The caption has
[literal]#++v-button-caption++# style. There is also an intermediate wrap
element, which may help in styling in some cases.

Some built-in themes contain a small style, which you can enable by adding
[parameter]#Reindeer.BUTTON_SMALL#, etc. The [classname]#BaseTheme# also has a
[parameter]#BUTTON_LINK# style, which makes the button look like a hyperlink.
