     * Depending on the used WidgetMap generator, these optional hints may be
     * used to define how the client side components are loaded by the browser.
     * The default is to eagerly load all widgets
     * {@link com.vaadin.server.widgetsetutils.EagerWidgetMapGenerator}, but if
     * the {@link com.vaadin.server.widgetsetutils.WidgetMapGenerator} is used
     * by the widgetset, these load style hints are respected.
     * <p>
     * Lazy loading of a widget implementation means the client side component
     * is not included in the initial JavaScript application loaded when the
     * application starts. Instead the implementation is loaded to the client
     * when it is first needed. Lazy loaded widget can be achieved by giving
     * {@link LoadStyle#LAZY} value in {@link Connect} annotation.
     * <p>
     * Lazy loaded widgets don't stress the size and startup time of the client
     * side as much as eagerly loaded widgets. On the other hand there is a
     * slight latency when lazy loaded widgets are first used as the client side
     * needs to visit the server to fetch the client side implementation.
     * <p>
     * The {@link LoadStyle#DEFERRED} will also not stress the initially loaded
     * JavaScript file. If this load style is defined, the widget implementation
     * is preemptively loaded to the browser after the application is started
     * and the communication to server idles. This load style kind of combines
     * the best of both worlds.
     * <p>
     * Fine tunings to widget loading can also be made by overriding
     * {@link com.vaadin.server.widgetsetutils.WidgetMapGenerator} in the GWT
     * module. Tunings might be helpful if the end users have slow connections
     * and especially if they have high latency in their network. The
     * {@link com.vaadin.server.widgetsetutils.CustomWidgetMapGenerator} is an
     * abstract generator implementation for easy customization. Vaadin package
     * also includes
     * {@link com.vaadin.server.widgetsetutils.LazyWidgetMapGenerator} that
     * makes as many widgets lazily loaded as possible.
