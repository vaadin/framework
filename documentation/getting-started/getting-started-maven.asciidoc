[[getting-started.maven]]
= Creating a Project with Maven

((("Maven", "creating a project", id="term.maven.creating", range="startofrange")))

In previous sections, we looked into creating a Vaadin Maven project in different IDEs.
In this section, we look how to create such a project on command-line.
You can then import such a project to your IDE.

In addition to regular Maven, you can use any Maven-compatible build or
dependency management system, such as Ivy or Gradle. For Gradle, see the
link:https://github.com/johndevs/gradle-vaadin-plugin[Gradle Vaadin Plugin].
Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse uses Ivy for resolving dependencies in Vaadin
projects, and it should provide you with the basic Ivy configuration.

For an interactive guide, see the instructions at link:https://vaadin.com/maven[vaadin.com/maven].
It automatically generates you the command to create a new project based on archetype selection.
It can also generate dependency declarations for Vaadin dependencies.

[[getting-started.maven.command-line]]
== Working from Command-Line

You can create a new Maven project with the following command (given in one
line):

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#mvn# archetype:generate \
   -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vaadin \
   -DarchetypeArtifactId=[replaceable]#vaadin-archetype-application# \
   -DarchetypeVersion=[replaceable]#7.x.x# \
   -DgroupId=[replaceable]#your.company# \
   -DartifactId=[replaceable]#project-name# \
   -Dversion=[replaceable]#0.1# \
   -Dpackaging=war
----
The parameters are as follows:

[parameter]#archetypeGroupId#:: The group ID of the archetype is [literal]#++com.vaadin++# for Vaadin
archetypes.

[parameter]#archetypeArtifactId#:: The archetype ID.
See the list of available archetypes in <<dummy/../../../framework/getting-started-archetypes#getting-started.archetypes,"Overview of Maven Archetypes">>.

[parameter]#archetypeVersion#::
Version of the archetype to use.
This should be [literal]#++LATEST++# for normal Vaadin releases.
For prerelease versions it should be the exact version number, such as [literal]#++7.6.4++#.

[parameter]#groupId#:: A Maven group ID for your project. It is normally your organization domain name
in reverse order, such as com.example. The group ID is also used as a prefix for
the Java package in the sources, so it should be Java compatible - only
alphanumerics and an underscore.

[parameter]#artifactId#:: Identifier of the artifact, that is, your project. The identifier may contain
alphanumerics, minus, and underscore. It is appended to the group ID to obtain
the Java package name for the sources. For example, if the group ID is
com.example and artifact ID is myproject, the project sources would be placed in
com.example.myproject package.

[parameter]#version#:: Initial version number of your application. The number must obey the Maven
version numbering format.

[parameter]#packaging#:: How will the project be packaged. It is normally [literal]#++war++#.



Creating a project can take a while as Maven fetches all the dependencies. The
created project structure is shown in
<<figure.getting-started.maven.archetype.created>>.

[[getting-started.maven.compiling]]
== Compiling and Running the Application

((("Maven", "compiling", id="term.maven.compiling", range="startofrange")))


Before the application can be deployed, it must be compiled and packaged as a
WAR package. You can do this with the [literal]#++package++# goal as follows:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#mvn# package
----
The location of the resulting WAR package should be displayed in the command
output. You can then deploy it to your favorite application server.

The easiest way to run Vaadin applications with Maven is to use the light-weight
Jetty web server. After compiling the package, all you need to do is type:

[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#mvn# jetty:run
----
The special goal starts the Jetty server in port 8080 and deploys the
application. You can then open it in a web browser at
http://localhost:8080/project-name.

[[getting-started.maven.addons]]
== Using Add-ons and Custom Widget Sets

((("Maven", "using add-ons", id="term.maven.addons", range="startofrange")))


If you use Vaadin add-ons that include a widget set or make your custom widgets,
you need to enable widget set compilation in the POM. The required configuration
is described in
<<dummy/../../../framework/addons/addons-maven#addons.maven,"Using Add-ons in a
Maven Project">>.
