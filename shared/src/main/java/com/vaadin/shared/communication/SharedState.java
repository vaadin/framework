/**
 * Interface to be implemented by all shared state classes used to communicate
 * basic information about a {@link Connector} from server to client.
 *
 * Shared state classes have to be declared in shared package to be accessible
 * both for server and client code.
 *
 * Shared state objects are only sent from the server to the client, and any
 * modifications from the client should be performed via an RPC call that
 * modifies the authoritative state on the server.
 *
 * A shared state class should be a bean with getters and setters for each
 * field. Supported data types are simple Java types, other beans and maps and
 * arrays of these.
 *
 * On the client side the connector should override
 * {@link com.vaadin.client.ui.AbstractConnector#getState()} to return the
 * correct state type. This automatically causes a correct state object to be
 * created.
 *
 * Subclasses of a {@link Connector} using shared state should also provide a
 * subclass of the shared state class of the parent class to extend the state. A
 * single {@link Connector} can only have one shared state object.
 *
