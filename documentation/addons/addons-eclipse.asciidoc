= Installing Add-ons in Eclipse with Ivy

If you have a project that uses Apache Ivy to resolve dependencies, they should be listed in the [filename]#ivy.xml# file in the project root.
Vaadin Directory allows downloading add-ons from a Maven repository, which can also be accessed by Ivy.

You can also use Ivy to resolve dependencies in an Ant script.

. Open the add-on page in Vaadin Directory.

. Select the version. The latest is shown by default, but you can choose another
the version from the dropdown menu in the header of the add-on details page.

. Click the [guilabel]#Maven/Ivy# to display the Ivy dependency declaration, as
illustrated in Figure <<figure.addons.eclipse.ivybutton>>. If the add-on is
available with multiple licenses, you will be prompted to select a license for
the dependency.

. Open the [filename]#ivysettings.xml# in your Eclipse project either in the XML
or Ivy Editor (either double-click the file or right-click it and select "Open
With > Ivy Editor").

+
Check that the settings file has the [literal]#++<ibiblio>++# entry given in the
Directory page. It should be, if the file was created by the Vaadin project
wizard in Eclipse. If not, copy it there.

<chain name="default">
  ...
  <ibiblio name="vaadin-addons"
           usepoms="true"
           m2compatible="true"
           root="http://maven.vaadin.com/vaadin-addons"/>
  ...
</chain>

+
If you get Vaadin addons from another repository, such as the local repository
if you have compiled them yourself, you need to define a resolver for the
repository in the settings file.

. Open the [filename]#ivy.xml# in your Eclipse project and copy the Ivy dependency
to inside the [literal]#++dependencies++# element. It should be as follows:


+
[subs="normal"]
----
&lt;dependencies&gt;
    ...
    &lt;dependency org="**com.vaadin.addon**"
                name="**vaadin-charts**"
                rev="**1.0.0**"/&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;
----
+
You can specify either a fixed version number or a dynamic revision tag, such as
[literal]#++latest.release++#. You can find more information about the
link:http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.1.0/ivyfile/dependency.html[dependency
declarations] in Ivy documentation.

+
If the [filename]#ivy.xml# does not have a [literal]#++<configurations
defaultconfmapping="default->default">++# defined, you also need to have
[literal]#++conf="default->default"++# in the dependency to resolve transient
dependencies correctly.

+
IvyIDE immediately resolves the dependencies when you save the file.

. Compile the add-on widget set by clicking the [guilabel]#Compile Vaadin Widgetset# button in the toolbar.

If you experience problems with Ivy, first check all the dependency parameters.
IvyDE can sometimes cause unexpected problems. You can clear the Ivy dependency
cache by right-clicking the project and selecting "Ivy > Clean all caches". To
refresh Ivy configuration, select "Ivy > Refresh". To try resolving again Ivy,
select "Ivy > Resolve".
