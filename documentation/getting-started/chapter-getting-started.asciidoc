== Creating a Vaadin Application

TIP: If you are new to Vaadin, we suggest to start with <<../tutorial#tutorial,"the tutorial">>. It also contains instructions how to set up Eclipse based development environment.

This chapter gives practical instructions for creating a Vaadin application project and deploying it to a server to run it. We also consider topics such as debugging.

The instructions are given separately for the Eclipse IDE, NetBeans, and IntelliJ IDEA.
