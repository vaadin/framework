= Creating a Server-Side Component

Typical server-side Vaadin applications use server-side components that are
rendered on the client-side using their counterpart widgets. A server-side
component must manage state synchronization between the widget on the
client-side, in addition to any server-side logic.

== Basic Server-Side Component

The component state is usually managed by a __shared state__, described later in
<<dummy/../../../framework/gwt/gwt-shared-state#gwt.shared-state,"Shared
State">>.

public class MyComponent extends AbstractComponent {
    public MyComponent() {
        getState().setText("This is MyComponent");
    }

    @Override
    protected MyComponentState getState() {
        return (MyComponentState) super.getState();
    }
}
