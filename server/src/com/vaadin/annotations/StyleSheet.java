 * If this annotation is present on a {@link ClientConnector} class, the
 * framework ensures the referenced style sheets are loaded before the init
 * method for the corresponding client-side connector is invoked.
 * <p>
 * Absolute URLs including protocol and host are used as is on the client-side.
 * Relative urls are mapped to APP/PUBLISHED/[url] which are by default served
 * from the classpath relative to the class where the annotation is defined.
 * <p>
 * Example: {@code @StyleSheet( "http://host.com/file1.css", "file2.css"})} on
 * the class com.example.MyConnector would load the file
 * http://host.com/file1.css as is and file2.css from /com/example/file2.css on
 * the server's classpath using the ClassLoader that was used to load
 * com.example.MyConnector.
