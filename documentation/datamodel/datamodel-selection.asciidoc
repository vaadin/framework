TODO

* A Listing may let the user mark one or several of its items as selected.
* Some listings only support having one item selected at a time
** Code example: Setting, getting and reacting to events from a NativeSelect
** Design question: Is nullSelectionAllowed a feature of each component or a feature of the selection model?
* Other listings can be configured to allow selecting one or many items. Depending on how it is configured, it uses a different selection model type for working with the selection.
** Code example: CheckBoxGroup/RadioButtonGroup. Using different selection model types to access the selection.
** Code example: Using each selection model type with a Binder
