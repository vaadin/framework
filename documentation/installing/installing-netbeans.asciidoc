= Installing the NetBeans IDE and Plugin

Vaadin offers official support for the NetBeans IDE.
The Vaadin Plug-in for NetBeans supports creating Vaadin projects, updating Vaadin libraries, compiling widget sets, and more.
It also allows directly downloading Vaadin add-ons from the Vaadin Directory.

The installation bundle includes a web server, so you do not need that.

Once done with the installation, you can proceed to create a Vaadin project, as described in <<../getting-started/getting-started-netbeans#getting-started.netbeans, "Creating a Project with the NetBeans IDE">>.

== Installing the NetBeans IDE

Download NetBeans IDE from the website at https://netbeans.org/downloads/[netbeans.org].
We recommend using the _Java EE_ download bundle, which includes support for Java EE, and also both the GlassFish and Tomcat application servers.

. Run the installer

.. In OS X and Linux:
+
[subs="normal"]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#sh# [replaceable]#netbeans-<version>.sh#
----

. Select to install either GlassFish or Apache Tomcat, or both.
GlassFish supports Java EE, which is required by Vaadin CDI and Vaadin Spring add-ons, while standard Tomcat does not support it.
Click [guibutton]#Next#.

Click [guibutton]#Next#.
