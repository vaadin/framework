/**
 * Annotation used to mark client RPC methods, state fields, or state setter
 * methods that should not trigger a layout phase after changes have been
 * processed. Whenever there's at least one change that is not marked with this
 * annotation, the framework will assume some sizes might have changed an will
 * therefore start a layout phase after applying the changes.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can be used for any RPC method or state property that does
 * not cause the size of the component or its children to change. Please note
 * that almost anything related to CSS (e.g. adding or removing a stylename) has
 * the potential of causing sizes to change with appropriate style definitions
 * in the application theme.
