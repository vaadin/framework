/**
 * Container needed by large lazy loading hierarchies displayed e.g. in
 * TreeTable.
 * <p>
 * Container of this type gets notified when a subtree is opened/closed in a
 * component displaying its content. This allows container to lazy load subtrees
 * and release memory when a sub-tree is no longer displayed.
 * <p>
 * Methods from {@link Container.Ordered} (and from {@linkContainer.Indexed} if
 * implemented) are expected to work as in "preorder" of the currently visible
 * hierarchy. This means for example that the return value of size method
 * changes when subtree is collapsed/expanded. In other words items in collapsed
 * sub trees should be "ignored" by container when the container is accessed
 * with methods introduced in {@link Container.Ordered} or
 * {@linkContainer.Indexed}. From the accessors point of view, items in
 * collapsed subtrees don't exist.
 * <p>
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@code TreeGrid.addExpandListener()} and
 *             {@code TreeGrid.addCollapseListener()}.
