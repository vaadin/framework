/**
 * <p>
 * A specialized set of identified Items. Basically the Container is a set of
 * {@link Item}s, but it imposes certain constraints on its contents. These
 * constraints state the following:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>All Items in the Container must have the same number of Properties.
 * <li>All Items in the Container must have the same Property ID's (see
 * {@link Item#getItemPropertyIds()}).
 * <li>All Properties in the Items corresponding to the same Property ID must
 * have the same data type.
 * <li>All Items within a container are uniquely identified by their non-null
 * IDs.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The Container can be visualized as a representation of a relational database
 * table. Each Item in the Container represents a row in the table, and all
 * cells in a column (identified by a Property ID) have the same data type. Note
 * that as with the cells in a database table, no Property in a Container may be
 * empty, though they may contain <code>null</code> values.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that though uniquely identified, the Items in a Container are not
 * necessarily {@link Container.Ordered ordered} or {@link Container.Indexed
 * indexed}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Containers can derive Item ID's from the item properties or use other,
 * container specific or user specified identifiers.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If a container is {@link Filterable filtered} or {@link Sortable sorted},
 * most of the the methods of the container interface and its subinterfaces
 * (container size, {@link #containsId(Object)}, iteration and indices etc.)
 * relate to the filtered and sorted view, not to the full container contents.
 * See individual method javadoc for exceptions to this (adding and removing
 * items).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <img src=doc-files/Container_full.gif>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The Container interface is split to several subinterfaces so that a class can
 * implement only the ones it needs.
 * </p>
