Once you have installed a development environment, as described in the previous chapter, creating a Vaadin project proceeds in the IDE that you have chosen.

The Vaadin core library and all Vaadin add-ons are available through Maven, a commonly used build and dependency management system.

The recommended way to create a Vaadin application project is to use a Maven archetype.
The archetypes contain all the needed dependencies, which Maven takes care of.
The Eclipse IDE plugin currently also supports creating a normal Eclipse web project using the Ivy dependency manager.

In this chapter, we give:

. An overview of the Vaadin libraries
. List the available Maven archetypes
. Step-by-step instructions for creating a project in the Eclipse IDE, NetBeans IDE, and IntelliJ IDEA, as well as with command-line.
