#
# HA/Lock configuration
#
# Karaf uses a lock mechanism to know which instance is the master (HA)
# The lock can be on the filesystem (default) or on a database.
#
# See http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/users-guide/failover.html for details.
#
# Even using a single instance, Karaf creates the lock file
# You can specify the location of the lock file using the
# karaf.lock.dir=/path/to/the/directory/containing/the/lock
#
# By default, the slave instances start but are passive.
# If you want to prevent the slave instances startup, you can use
# the karaf.lock.slave.block property (false by default):
# karaf.lock.slave.block=true
