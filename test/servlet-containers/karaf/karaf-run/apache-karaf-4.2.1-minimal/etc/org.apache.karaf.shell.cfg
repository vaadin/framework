# These properties are used to configure Karaf's ssh shell.
#

#
# Via sshPort and sshHost you define the address you can login into Karaf.
#
sshPort = 8101
sshHost = 0.0.0.0

#
# The sshIdleTimeout defines the inactivity timeout to logout the SSH session.
# The sshIdleTimeout is in milliseconds, and the default is set to 30 minutes.
#
sshIdleTimeout = 1800000

#
# sshRealm defines which JAAS domain to use for password authentication.
#
sshRealm = karaf

#
# sshRole defines the role required to access the console through ssh
#
sshRole = ssh

#
# Defines if the SFTP system is enabled or not in the SSH server
#
sftpEnabled=true

#
# The location of the hostKey file defines where the private/public key of the server
# is located. If no file is at the defined location it will be ignored.
#
hostKey = ${karaf.etc}/host.key

#
# The format used for hostKey.
#Â Possible values are simple (Karaf internal), or PEM (OpenSSH format)
#
hostKeyFormat = simple

#
# Self defined key size in 1024, 2048, 3072, or 4096
# If not set, this defaults to 2048.
#
# keySize = 2048

#
# Specify host key algorithm, defaults to RSA
#
# algorithm = RSA

#
# Specify the client log level (default is WARN)
# 0: ERROR
# 1: WARN
# 2: INFO
# 3: DEBUG
# 4: TRACE
#
#logLevel = 1

#
# Specify an additional welcome banner to be displayed when a user logs into the server.

#
# Defines the completion mode on the Karaf shell console. The possible values are:
# - GLOBAL: it's the same behavior as in previous Karaf releases. The completion displays all commands and all aliases
#           ignoring if you are in a subshell or not.
# - FIRST: the completion displays all commands and all aliases only when you are not in a subshell. When you are
#          in a subshell, the completion displays only the commands local to the subshell.
# - SUBSHELL: the completion displays only the subshells on the root level. When you are in a subshell, the completion
#             displays only the commands local to the subshell.
# This property define the default value when you use the Karaf shell console.
# You can change the completion mode directly in the shell console, using shell:completion command.

#
# macs = hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha1

#
# Override allowed SSH key exchange algorithms.
# Default: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp256,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1

# moduli-url = external moduli-url users wanna use
