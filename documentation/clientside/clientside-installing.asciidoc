= Installing the Client-Side Development Environment

The installation of the client-side development libraries is described in
<<dummy/../../../framework/getting-started/getting-started-overview.asciidoc#getting-started.overview,"Getting
Started with Vaadin">>. You especially need the [filename]#vaadin-client#
library, which contains the client-side Java API, and
[filename]#vaadin-client-compiler#, which contains the Vaadin Client Compiler
for compiling Java to JavaScript.
