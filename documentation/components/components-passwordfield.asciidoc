[[components.passwordfield]]

The [classname]#PasswordField# is a variant of [classname]#TextField# that hides
the typed input from visual inspection.

PasswordField tf = new PasswordField("Keep it secret");

See the http://demo.vaadin.com/book-examples-vaadin7/book#component.passwordfield.basic[on-line example, window="_blank"].

You should note that the [classname]#PasswordField# hides the input only from
"over the shoulder" visual observation. Unless the server connection is
encrypted with a secure connection, such as HTTPS, the input is transmitted in
clear text and may be intercepted by anyone with low-level access to the
network. Also phishing attacks that intercept the input in the browser may be
possible by exploiting JavaScript execution security holes in the browser.

same [literal]#++v-textfield++# style as the regular [classname]#TextField#. See
