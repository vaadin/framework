= Compiling and Running a Client-Side Application

__Compilation of client-side modules other than widget sets with the Vaadin
Plugin for Eclipse has recent changes and limitations at the time of writing of
this edition and the information given here may not be accurate.__

The application needs to be compiled into JavaScript to run it in a browser. For
deployment, and also initially for the first time when running the Development
Mode, you need to do the compilation with the Vaadin Client Compiler, as
described in
<<../clientside/clientside-compiling#clientside.compiling,"Compiling
a Client-Side Module">>.

During development, it is easiest to use the SuperDevMode, which also quickly
launching the client-side code and also allows debugging. See
<<../clientside/clientside-debugging#clientside.debugging,"Debugging
Client-Side Code">> for more details.
