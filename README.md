# Vaadin Framework

*[Vaadin](https://vaadin.com) allows you to build modern web apps efficiently in plain Java, without touching low level web technologies.*

This repository serves as an archive of the source code and issue tracking for Vaadin 8 and Vaadin 7. Both use GWT as the base of client-side implementations. Vaadin 8 includes Vaadin 7 compatibility classes. You can find source code and issue tracking for newer, web component based Vaadin versions in [vaadin/platform](https://github.com/vaadin/platform).

The code in this repository reflects the state of Vaadin 8.14.4 and Vaadin 7.7.17, the last releases made available under the Apache-2 license, and will be left as-is.
