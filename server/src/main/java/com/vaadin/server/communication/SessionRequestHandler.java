/**
 * Handles a request by passing it to each registered {@link RequestHandler} in
 * the session in turn until one produces a response. This method is used for
 * requests that have not been handled by any specific functionality in the
 * servlet/portlet.
 * <p>
 * The request handlers are invoked in the reverse order in which they were
 * added to the session until a response has been produced. This means that the
 * most recently added handler is used first and the first request handler that
 * was added to the session is invoked towards the end unless any previous
 * handler has already produced a response.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The session is not locked during execution of the request handlers. The
 * request handler can itself decide if it needs to lock the session or not.
