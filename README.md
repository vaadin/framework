# Vaadin Framework

*[Vaadin](https://vaadin.com) allows you to build modern web apps efficiently in plain Java, without touching low level web technologies.*

This repository serves as an archive of the source code and issue tracking for Vaadin 8 and Vaadin 7. Both use GWT as the base of client-side implementations. Vaadin 8 includes Vaadin 7 compatibility classes. You can find source code and issue tracking for newer, web component based Vaadin versions in [vaadin/platform](https://github.com/vaadin/platform).

The code in this repository reflects the state of Vaadin 8.14.3 and Vaadin 7.7.17, the last releases made available under the Apache-2 license, and will be left as-is.

## NOTICE

Starting with versions 7.7.30\* and 8.15.0, no new code is being released here, as development now happens in a private repository. However, releases are being published as courtesy notifications to the users who have subscribed to the release feed of this repository. The source code attached to Github releases in this repository reflects the state of code ***in this respository*** at time of release. It is ***NOT*** the source code of the corresponding Extended Maintenance release.

\* Note: 7.7.17 is the last Apache-2 licensed version, however in the beginning of the transition phase extended maintenance version changes to the 7.7 branch were being made here. In order to be in compliance with the license terms, you are only allowed to use 7.7 code up to [release 7.7.17](https://github.com/vaadin/framework/releases/tag/7.7.17).
