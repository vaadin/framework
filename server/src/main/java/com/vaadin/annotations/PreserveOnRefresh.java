/**
 * Marks a UI that should be retained when the user refreshed the browser
 * window. By default, a new UI instance is created when refreshing, causing any
 * UI state not captured in the URL or the URI fragment to get discarded. By
 * adding this annotation to a UI class, the framework will instead reuse the
 * current UI instance when a reload is detected.
 * <p>
 * Whenever a request is received that reloads a preserved UI, the UI's
 * {@link UI#refresh(com.vaadin.server.VaadinRequest) refresh} method is invoked
 * by the framework.
 * <p>
 * By using
 * {@link UIProvider#isPreservedOnRefresh(com.vaadin.server.UICreateEvent)}, the
 * decision can also be made dynamically based on other parameters than only
 * whether this annotation is present on the UI class.
