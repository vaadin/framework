= Vaadin Installation Package

While the recommended way to create a Vaadin project and install the libraries is to use an IDE plugin or a dependency management system, such as Maven, Vaadin is also available as a ZIP distribution package.

You can download the newest Vaadin installation package from the download page
at https://vaadin.com/download/. Please use a ZIP decompression utility available
in your operating system to extract the files from the ZIP package.
