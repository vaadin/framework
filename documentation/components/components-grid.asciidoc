((("[classname]#Grid#")))
[classname]#Grid# is many things, and perhaps the most versatile and powerful
component in Vaadin. Like [classname]#Table#, it allows presenting and editing
tabular data, but escapes many of [classname]#Table#'s limitations. Efficient
lazy loading of data while scrolling greatly improves performance. Grid is
scalable, mobile friendly, and extensible.

[[components.grid.overview]]
== Overview

[classname]#Grid# is for displaying and editing tabular data laid out in rows
and columns. At the top, a __header__ can be shown, and a __footer__ at the
bottom. In addition to plain text, the header and footer can contain HTML and
components. Having components in the header allows implementing filtering
easily. The grid data can be sorted by clicking on a column header;
shift-clicking a column header enables secondary sorting criteria.

[[figure.components.grid.features]]

The data area can be scrolled both vertically and horizontally. The leftmost
columns can be frozen, so that they are never scrolled out of the view. The data
is loaded lazily from the server, so that only the visible data is loaded. The
smart lazy loading functionality gives excellent user experience even with low
bandwidth, such as mobile devices.

The grid data can be edited with a row-based editor after double-clicking a row.
The fields are generated with a field factory, or set explicitly, and bound to
data with a field group.

Grid is fully themeable with CSS and style names can be set for all grid
elements. For data rows and cells, the styles can be generated with a row or
cell style generator.

Finally, [classname]#Grid# is designed to be extensible and used just as well
for client-side development - its GWT API is nearly identical to the server-side
API, including data binding.

[[components.grid.overview.table]]
=== Differences to Table

In addition to core features listed above, [classname]#Grid# has the following
API-level and functional differences to Table:

* Grid is not a [interfacename]#Container# itself, even though it can be bound to a container data source. Consequently, columns are defined differently, and so forth.
* Rows can be added with [methodname]#addRow()# shorthand (during initialization) instead of [methodname]#addItem()#.
* Use [methodname]#setHeightByRows()# and [methodname]#setHeightMode()# instead of [methodname]#setPageLength()# to set the height in number of rows.
* Grid does not extend [classname]#AbstractSelect# and is not a field, but has its own selection API. [methodname]#addSelectionListener()# is called to define a [interfacename]#SelectionListener#. The listener also receives a collection of deselected items.
* Grid does not support having all cells in editable mode, it only supports row-based editing, with a row mini-editor that allows saving or discarding the changes.
* Grid has no generated columns. Instead, the container data source can be wrapped around a [classname]#GeneratedPropertyContainer#.
* No column icons; you can implement them in a column with an [classname]#ImageRenderer#.
* Components can not be shown in Grid cells; instead the much more efficient renderers can be used for the most common cases, and row editor for editing values.
* Limited support for drag and drop: the user can drag columns to reorder them.

In addition, Grid has the following visual changes:

* Multiple selection is indicated with check boxes in addition to highlighting.
* Grid does not show the row loading indicator like Table does.



[[components.grid.data]]
== Binding to Data

[classname]#Grid# is normally used by binding it to a container data source,
described in
<<dummy/../../../framework/datamodel/datamodel-container#datamodel.container,"Collecting
Items in Containers">>. The container must implement
[interfacename]#Container.Indexed# interface. By default, it is bound to an
[classname]#IndexedContainer#; Grid offers some shorthand methods to operate on
the default container, as described later.

You can set the container in the constructor or with
[methodname]#setContainerDataSource()#.

For example, if you have a collection of beans, you could wrap them in a Vaadin
[classname]#BeanContainer# or [classname]#BeanItemContainer#, and bind to a [classname]#Grid# as follows


[source, java]
----
// Have some data
Collection<Person> people = Lists.newArrayList(
    new Person("Nicolaus Copernicus", 1543),
    new Person("Galileo Galilei", 1564),
    new Person("Johannes Kepler", 1571));

// Have a container of some type to contain the data
BeanItemContainer<Person> container =
    new BeanItemContainer<Person>(Person.class, people);

// Create a grid bound to the container
Grid grid = new Grid(container);
grid.setColumnOrder("name", "born");
layout.addComponent(grid);
----

Note that you need to override [methodname]#equals()# and [methodname]#hashcode()# for
the bean ([classname]#Person#) class to make the [classname]#BeanItemContainer# work properly.

[[components.grid.basic.manual]]
=== Default Data Source and Shorthands

Sometimes, when you have just a few fixed items that you want to display, you
can define the grid columns and add data rows manually. [classname]#Grid# is by
default bound to a [classname]#IndexedContainer#. You can define new columns
(container properties) with [methodname]#addColumn()# and then add rows (items)
with [methodname]#addRow()#. The types in the row data must match the defined
column types.

For example:


[source, java]
----
// Create a grid
Grid grid = new Grid();

// Define some columns
grid.addColumn("name", String.class);
grid.addColumn("born", Integer.class);

// Add some data rows
grid.addRow("Nicolaus Copernicus", 1543);
grid.addRow("Galileo Galilei", 1564);
grid.addRow("Johannes Kepler", 1571);

layout.addComponent(grid);
----

Or, if you have the data in an array:


[source, java]
----
// Have some data
Object[][] people = { {"Nicolaus Copernicus", 1543},
                      {"Galileo Galilei", 1564},
                      {"Johannes Kepler", 1571}};
for (Object[] person: people)
    grid.addRow(person);
----

Note that you can not use [methodname]#addRow()# to add items if the container
is read-only or has read-only columns, such as generated columns.



[[components.grid.selection]]
== Handling Selection Changes

Selection in [classname]#Grid# is handled a bit differently from other selection
components, as it is not an [classname]#AbstractSelect#. Grid supports both
single and multiple selection, defined by the __selection mode__. Selection
events can be handled with a [interfacename]#SelectionListener#.

[[components.grid.selection.mode]]
=== Selection Mode

A [classname]#Grid# can be set to be in [literal]#++SINGLE++# (default),
[literal]#++MULTI++#, or [literal]#++NONE++# selection mode, defined in the
[classname]#Grid.SelectionMode# enum.


[source, java]
----
// Use single-selection mode (default)
grid.setSelectionMode(SelectionMode.SINGLE);
----

Empty (null) selection is allowed by default, but can be disabled
with [methodname]#setDeselectAllowed()# in single-selection mode.

The selection is handled with a different selection model object in each
respective selection mode: [classname]#SingleSelectionModel#,
[classname]#MultiSelectionModel#, and [classname]#NoSelectionModel# (in which
selection is always empty).


[source, java]
----
// Pre-select an item
SingleSelectionModel selection =
    (SingleSelectionModel) grid.getSelectionModel();
selection.select( // Select 3rd item
    grid.getContainerDataSource().getIdByIndex(2));
----


[[components.grid.selection.single]]
=== Handling Selection

Changes in the selection can be handled with a
[interfacename]#SelectionListener#. You need to implement the
[methodname]#select()# method, which gets a [classname]#SelectionEvent# as
parameter. In addition to selection, you can handle clicks on rows or cells with
a [interfacename]#ItemClickListener#.

You can get the new selection from the selection event with
[methodname]#getSelected()#, which returns a set of item IDs, or more simply
from the grid or the selection model with [methodname]#getSelectedRow()#, which
returns the single selected item ID.

For example:


[source, java]
----
grid.addSelectionListener(selectionEvent -> { // Java 8
    // Get selection from the selection model
    Object selected = ((SingleSelectionModel)
        grid.getSelectionModel()).getSelectedRow();

    if (selected != null)
        Notification.show("Selected " +
            grid.getContainerDataSource().getItem(selected)
                .getItemProperty("name"));
    else
        Notification.show("Nothing selected");
});
----

The current selection can be obtained from the [classname]#Grid# object by
[methodname]#getSelectedRow()# or [methodname]#getSelectedRows()#, which return
one (in single-selection mode) or all (in multi-selection mode) selected items.


[WARNING]
====
Note that changes to the item set of the container data source are not
automatically reflected in the selection model and may cause the selection model
to refer to stale item IDs. This always occurs, for example, when you delete the
selected item or items. So, if you modify the item set of the container, you
should synchronize or reset the selection with the container, such as by calling
[methodname]#reset()# on the selection model.

====




[[components.grid.selection.multi]]
=== Multiple Selection

In the multiple selection mode, a user can select multiple items by clicking on
the checkboxes in the leftmost column, or by using the kbd:[Space] to select/deselect the currently focused row.
Space bar is the default key for toggling the selection, but it can be customized.

[[figure.components.grid.selection.multi]]
.Multiple Selection in  [classname]#Grid#
image::img/grid-selection-multi.png[width=50%, scaledwidth=75%]

The selection is managed through the [classname]#MultiSelectionMode# class. The
currently selected rows can be set with [methodname]#setSelected()# by a
collection of item IDs, or you can use [methodname]#select()# to add items to
the selection.


[source, java]
----
// Grid in multi-selection mode
Grid grid = new Grid(exampleDataSource());
grid.setSelectionMode(SelectionMode.MULTI);

// Pre-select some items
MultiSelectionModel selection =
    (MultiSelectionModel) grid.getSelectionModel();
selection.setSelected( // Items 2-4
    grid.getContainerDataSource().getItemIds(2, 3));

----

The current selection can be read with [methodname]#getSelectedRows()#; either
in the [classname]#MultiSelectionMode# object or in the [classname]#Grid#.


[source, java]
----
// Allow deleting the selected items
Button delSelected = new Button("Delete Selected", e -> {
    // Delete all selected data items
    for (Object itemId: selection.getSelectedRows())
        grid.getContainerDataSource().removeItem(itemId);

    // Otherwise out of sync with container
    grid.getSelectionModel().reset();

    // Disable after deleting
    e.getButton().setEnabled(false);
});
delSelected.setEnabled(grid.getSelectedRows().size() > 0);
----

Changes in the selection can be handled with a
[interfacename]#SelectionListener#. The selection event object provides
[methodname]#getAdded()# and [methodname]#getRemoved()# to allow determining the
differences in the selection change.


[source, java]
----
// Handle selection changes
grid.addSelectionListener(selection -> { // Java 8
    Notification.show(selection.getAdded().size() +
                      " items added, " +
                      selection.getRemoved().size() +
                      " removed.");

    // Allow deleting only if there's any selected
    deleteSelected.setEnabled(
         grid.getSelectedRows().size() > 0);
});
----

[[components.grid.selection.disallowuser]]
=== Disallowing User Selection
It is possible to prevent the user from changing the selection in grid for both single- and multi-selection models:

[source, java]
----
HasUserSelectionAllowed model = (HasUserSelectionAllowed) grid.getSelectionModel();
model.setUserSelectionAllowed(false);
----

[NOTE]
All built-in selection models implement `HasUserSelectionAllowed` so the cast is generally safe.


[[components.grid.selection.clicks]]
=== Focus and Clicks

In addition to selecting rows, you can focus individual cells. The focus can be
moved with arrow keys and, if editing is enabled, pressing kbd:[Enter] opens the
editor. Normally, pressing kbd:[Tab] or kbd:[Shift+Tab] moves the focus to another component,
as usual.

When editing or in unbuffered mode, kbd:[Tab] or kbd:[Shift+Tab] moves the focus to the next or
previous cell. The focus moves from the last cell of a row forward to the
beginning of the next row, and likewise, from the first cell backward to the
end of the previous row. Note that you can extend [classname]#DefaultEditorEventHandler#
to change this behavior.

With the mouse, you can focus a cell by clicking on it. The clicks can be handled
with an [interfacename]#ItemClickListener#. The [classname]#ItemClickEvent#
object contains various information, most importantly the ID of the clicked row
and column.


[source, java]
----
grid.addItemClickListener(event -> // Java 8
    Notification.show("Value: " +
        container.getContainerProperty(event.getItemId(),
            event.getPropertyId()).getValue().toString()));
----

The clicked grid cell is also automatically focused.

The focus indication is themed so that the focused cell has a visible focus
indicator style by default, while the row doesn't. You can enable row focus, as
well as disable cell focus, in a custom theme. See <<components.grid.css>>.



[[components.grid.columns]]
== Configuring Columns

Columns are normally defined in the container data source. The
[methodname]#addColumn()# method can be used to add columns to a container that
supports it, such as the default [classname]#IndexedContainer#.

Column configuration is defined in [classname]#Grid.Column# objects, which can
be obtained from the grid with [methodname]#getColumn()# by the column
(property) ID.


[source, java]
----
Grid.Column bornColumn = grid.getColumn("born");
bornColumn.setHeaderCaption("Born");
----

In the following, we describe the basic column configuration.

[[components.grid.columns.order]]
=== Column Order

You can set the order of columns with [methodname]#setColumnOrder()# for the
grid. Columns that are not given for the method are placed after the specified
columns in their natural order.


[source, java]
----
grid.setColumnOrder("firstname", "lastname", "born",
                    "birthplace", "died");
----

Note that the method can not be used to hide columns. You can hide columns with
the [methodname]#removeColumn()#, as described later, or by hiding them in a
[classname]#GeneratedPropertyContainer#.


[[components.grid.columns.removing]]
=== Hiding Columns

Columns can be hidden by removing them with [methodname]#removeColumn()#. You
can remove all columns with [methodname]#removeAllColumns()#. The removed columns
are only removed from the grid, not from the container data source.

To restore a previously removed column, you can call [methodname]#addColumn()#
with the property ID. Instead of actually adding another column to the data
source, it merely restores the previously removed one. However, column settings
such as header or editor are not restored, but must be redone.

You can also hide columns at container-level. At least
[classname]#GeneratedpropertyContainer# allows doing so, as described in
<<dummy/../../../framework/datamodel/datamodel-container#datamodel.container.gpc,"GeneratedPropertyContainer">>.


[[components.grid.columns.captions]]
=== Column Captions

Column captions are displayed in the grid header. The default captions are
generated automatically from the property ID. You can set the header caption
explicitly through the column object with [methodname]#setHeaderCaption()#.


[source, java]
----
Grid.Column bornColumn = grid.getColumn("born");
bornColumn.setHeaderCaption("Born");
----

This is equivalent to setting it with [methodname]#setText()# for the header
cell; the [classname]#HeaderCell# also allows setting the caption in HTML or as
a component, as well as styling it, as described later in
<<components.grid.headerfooter>>.


[[components.grid.columns.width]]
=== Column Widths

Columns have by default undefined width, which causes automatic sizing based on
the widths of the displayed data. You can set column widths explicitly by pixel
value with [methodname]#setWidth()#, or relatively using expand ratios with
[methodname]#setExpandRatio()#.

When using expand ratios, the columns with a non-zero expand ratio use the extra
space remaining from other columns, in proportion to the defined ratios.

You can specify minimum and maximum widths for the expanding columns with
[methodname]#setMinimumWidth()# and [methodname]#setMaximumWidth()#,
respectively.

The user can resize columns by dragging their separators with the mouse. When resized manually,
all the columns widths are set to explicit pixel values, even if they had
relative values before.

[[components.grid.columns.frozen]]
=== Frozen Columns

You can set the number of columns to be frozen with
[methodname]#setFrozenColumnCount()#, so that they are not scrolled off when
scrolling horizontally.


[source, java]
----
grid.setFrozenColumnCount(2);
----

Setting the count to [parameter]#0# disables frozen data columns; setting it to
[parameter]#-1# also disables the selection column in multi-selection mode.



[[components.grid.generatedcolumns]]
== Generating Columns

Columns with values computed from other columns or in some other way can be
generated with a container or data model that generates the property values. The
[classname]#GeneratedPropertyContainer# can be used for this purpose. It wraps
around any indexed container to extend its properties with read-only generated
properties. The generated properties can have same IDs as the original ones,
thereby replacing them with formatted or converted values. See
<<dummy/../../../framework/datamodel/datamodel-container#datamodel.container.gpc,"GeneratedPropertyContainer">>
for a detailed description of using it.

Generated columns are read-only, so you can not add grid rows with
[methodname]#addRow()#. In editable mode, editor fields are not generated for
generated columns.

Note that, while [classname]#GeneratedPropertyContainer# implements
[interfacename]#Container.Sortable#, the wrapped container might not, and also
sorting on the generated properties requires special handling. In such cases,
generated properties or the entire container might not actually be sortable.

[[components.grid.renderer]]
== Column Renderers

A __renderer__ is a feature that draws the client-side representation of a data
value. This allows having images, HTML, and buttons in grid cells.

[[figure.components.grid.renderer]]
.Column renderers: image, date, HTML, and button
image::img/grid-renderers.png[width=75%, scaledwidth=100%]

Renderers implement the [interfacename]#Renderer# interface.
You set the column renderer in the [classname]#Grid.Column# object as follows:

[source, java]
----
grid.addColumn("born", Integer.class);
...
Grid.Column bornColumn = grid.getColumn("born");
bornColumn.setRenderer(new NumberRenderer("born in %d AD"));
----

Renderers require a specific data type for the column. To convert to a property
type to a type required by a renderer, you can pass an optional
[interfacename]#Converter# to [methodname]#setRenderer()#, as described later in
this section. A converter can also be used to (pre)format the property values.
The converter is run on the server-side, before sending the values to the
client-side to be rendered with the renderer.

The following renderers are available, as defined in the server-side
[package]#com.vaadin.ui.renderers# package:

[classname]#ButtonRenderer#:: Renders the data value as the caption of a button. A [interfacename]#RendererClickListener# can be given to handle the button clicks.

ifdef::web[]
+
Typically, a button renderer is used to display buttons for operating on a data
item, such as edit, view, delete, etc. It is not meaningful to store the button
captions in the data source, rather you want to generate them, and they are
usually all identical.
+
[source, java]
----
BeanItemContainer<Person> people =
    new BeanItemContainer<>(Person.class);

people.addBean(new Person("Nicolaus Copernicus", 1473));
people.addBean(new Person("Galileo Galilei", 1564));
people.addBean(new Person("Johannes Kepler", 1571));

// Generate button caption column
GeneratedPropertyContainer gpc =
    new GeneratedPropertyContainer(people);
gpc.addGeneratedProperty("delete",
    new PropertyValueGenerator<String>() {

    @Override
    public String getValue(Item item, Object itemId,
                           Object propertyId) {
        return "Delete"; // The caption
    }

    @Override
    public Class<String> getType() {
        return String.class;
    }
});

// Create a grid
Grid grid = new Grid(gpc);

// Render a button that deletes the data row (item)
grid.getColumn("delete")
    .setRenderer(new ButtonRenderer(e -> // Java 8
    grid.getContainerDataSource()
        .removeItem(e.getItemId())));
----
endif::web[]

[classname]#ImageRenderer#:: Renders the cell as an image.
The column type must be a [interfacename]#Resource#, as described in
<<dummy/../../../framework/application/application-resources#application.resources,"Images and Other Resources">>; only [classname]#ThemeResource# and
[classname]#ExternalResource# are currently supported for images in
[classname]#Grid#.

ifdef::web[]
+
[source, java]
----
grid.addColumn("picture", Resource.class)
    .setRenderer(new ImageRenderer());
...
// Add some data rows
grid.addRow(new ThemeResource("img/copernicus-128px.jpg"),
            "Nicolaus Copernicus", 1543);
grid.addRow(new ThemeResource("img/galileo-128px.jpg"),
            "Galileo Galilei", 1564);
----

+
Instead of creating the resource objects explicitly, as was done above, you
could generate them dynamically from file name strings using a
[interfacename]#Converter# for the column.

+
[source, java]
----
// Define some columns
grid.addColumn("picture", String.class); // Filename
grid.addColumn("name", String.class);

// Set the image renderer
grid.getColumn("picture").setRenderer(new ImageRenderer(),
    new Converter<Resource, String>() {
        @Override
        public String convertToModel(Resource value,
            Class<? extends String> targetType, Locale l)
            throws Converter.ConversionException {
            return "not needed";
        }

        @Override
        public Resource convertToPresentation(String value,
            Class<? extends Resource> targetType, Locale l)
            throws Converter.ConversionException {
            return new ThemeResource("img/" + value);
        }

        @Override
        public Class<String> getModelType() {
            return String.class;
        }

        @Override
        public Class<Resource> getPresentationType() {
            return Resource.class;
        }
});

// Add some data rows
grid.addRow("copernicus-128px.jpg", "Nicolaus Copernicus");
grid.addRow("galileo-128px.jpg", "Galileo Galilei");
grid.addRow("kepler-128px.jpg", "Johannes Kepler");
----
+
You also need to define the row heights so that the images fit there. You can
set it in the theme for all data cells or for the column containing the images.

+
For the latter way, first define a CSS style name for grid and the column:


+
[source, java]
----
grid.setStyleName("gridwithpics128px");
grid.setCellStyleGenerator(cell ->
    "picture".equals(cell.getPropertyId())?
        "imagecol" : null);
----
ifdef::web[]
+
Then, define the style in CSS (Sass):
endif::web[]


+
[source, css]
----
.gridwithpics128px .imagecol {
    height: 128px;
    background: black;
    text-align: center;
}
----
endif::web[]

[classname]#DateRenderer#:: Formats a column with a [classname]#Date# type using string formatter. The
format string is same as for [methodname]#String.format()# in Java API. The date
is passed in the parameter index 1, which can be omitted if there is only one
format specifier, such as "[literal]#++%tF++#".

ifdef::web[]
+
[source, java]
----
Grid.Column bornColumn = grid.getColumn("born");
bornColumn.setRenderer(
    new DateRenderer("%1$tB %1$te, %1$tY",
                     Locale.ENGLISH));
----

+
Optionally, a locale can be given. Otherwise, the default locale (in the
component tree) is used.

endif::web[]

[classname]#HTMLRenderer#:: Renders the cell as HTML. This allows formatting cell content, as well as using
HTML features such as hyperlinks.

ifdef::web[]
+
First, set the renderer in the [classname]#Grid.Column# object:
+
[source, java]
----
grid.addColumn("link", String.class)
    .setRenderer(new HtmlRenderer());
----
ifdef::web[]
+
Then, in the grid data, give the cell content:
endif::web[]

+
[source, java]
----
grid.addRow("Nicolaus Copernicus", 1543,
            "<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" +
            "Nicolaus_Copernicus' target='_top'>info</a>");
----
+
You could also use a [interfacename]#PropertyFormatter# or a generated column to
generate the HTML for the links.
endif::web[]

[classname]#NumberRenderer#:: Formats column values with a numeric type extending [classname]#Number#:
[classname]#Integer#, [classname]#Double#, etc. The format can be specified
either by the subclasses of [classname]#java.text.NumberFormat#, namely
[classname]#DecimalFormat# and [classname]#ChoiceFormat#, or by
[methodname]#String.format()#.

ifdef::web[]
+
For example:
+
[source, java]
----
// Define some columns
grid.addColumn("name", String.class);
grid.addColumn("born", Integer.class);
grid.addColumn("sletters", Integer.class);
grid.addColumn("rating", Double.class);

// Use decimal format
grid.getColumn("born").setRenderer(new NumberRenderer(
    new DecimalFormat("in #### AD")));

// Use textual formatting on numeric ranges
grid.getColumn("sletters").setRenderer(new NumberRenderer(
    new ChoiceFormat("0#none|1#one|2#multiple")));

// Use String.format() formatting
grid.getColumn("rating").setRenderer(new NumberRenderer(
    "%02.4f", Locale.ENGLISH));

// Add some data rows
grid.addRow("Nicolaus Copernicus", 1473, 2, 0.4);
grid.addRow("Galileo Galilei",     1564, 0, 4.2);
grid.addRow("Johannes Kepler",     1571, 1, 2.3);
----
endif::web[]
[classname]#ProgressBarRenderer#:: Renders a progress bar in a column with a [classname]#Double# type. The value
must be between 0.0 and 1.0.

ifdef::web[]
+
For example:
+
[source, java]
----
// Define some columns
grid.addColumn("name", String.class);
grid.addColumn("rating", Double.class)
    .setRenderer(new ProgressBarRenderer());

// Add some data rows
grid.addRow("Nicolaus Copernicus", 0.1);
grid.addRow("Galileo Galilei",     0.42);
grid.addRow("Johannes Kepler",     1.0);
----
endif::web[]
[classname]#TextRenderer#:: Displays plain text as is. Any HTML markup is quoted.



[[components.grid.renderer.custom]]
=== Custom Renderers

Renderers are component extensions that require a client-side counterpart. See
<<dummy/../../../framework/clientsidewidgets/clientsidewidgets-grid#clientsidewidgets.grid.renderers,"Renderers">>
for information on implementing custom renderers.


[[components.grid.renderer.converter]]
=== Converting for Rendering

Optionally, you can give a [interfacename]#Converter# in the
[methodname]#setRenderer()#, or define it for the column, to convert the data
value to an intermediary representation that is rendered by the renderer. For
example, when using an [classname]#ImageRenderer#, you could store the image file name
in the data column, which the converter would convert to a resource, which would
then be rendered by the renderer.

In the following example, we use a converter and [classname]#HTMLRenderer# to display boolean
values as [classname]#FontAwesome# icons
[source, java]
----
// Have a column for hyperlink paths to Wikipedia
grid.addColumn("truth", Boolean.class);
Grid.Column truth = grid.getColumn("truth");
truth.setRenderer(new HtmlRenderer(),
    new StringToBooleanConverter(
        FontAwesome.CHECK_CIRCLE_O.getHtml(),
        FontAwesome.CIRCLE_O.getHtml()));
...
----

In this example, we use a converter to format URL paths to complete
HTML hyperlinks with [classname]#HTMLRenderer#:


[source, java]
----
// Have a column for hyperlink paths to Wikipedia
grid.addColumn("link", String.class);

Grid.Column linkColumn = grid.getColumn("link");
linkColumn.setRenderer(new HtmlRenderer(),
                       new Converter<String,String>(){
    @Override
    public String convertToModel(String value,
        Class<? extends String> targetType, Locale locale)
        throws Converter.ConversionException {
        return "not implemented";
    }

    @Override
    public String convertToPresentation(String value,
        Class<? extends String> targetType, Locale locale)
        throws Converter.ConversionException {
        return "<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" +
                value + "' target='_blank'>more info</a>";
    }

    @Override
    public Class<String> getModelType() {
        return String.class;
    }

    @Override
    public Class<String> getPresentationType() {
        return String.class;
    }
});

// Data with a hyperlink path in the third column
grid.addRow("Nicolaus Copernicus", 1473,
            "Nicolaus_Copernicus");
...
----

A [classname]#GeneratedPropertyContainer# could be used for much the same
purpose.



[[components.grid.headerfooter]]
== Header and Footer

A grid by default has a header, which displays column names, and can have a
footer. Both can have multiple rows and neighbouring header row cells can be
joined to feature column groups.

[[components.grid.headerfooter.adding]]
=== Adding and Removing Header and Footer Rows

A new header row is added with [methodname]#prependHeaderRow()#, which adds it
at the top of the header, [methodname]#appendHeaderRow()#, which adds it at the
bottom of the header, or with [methodname]#addHeaderRowAt()#, which inserts it
at the specified 0-base index. All of the methods return a
[classname]#HeaderRow# object, which you can use to work on the header further.


[source, java]
----
// Group headers by joining the cells
HeaderRow groupingHeader = grid.prependHeaderRow();
...

// Create a header row to hold column filters
HeaderRow filterRow = grid.appendHeaderRow();
...
----

Similarly, you can add footer rows with [methodname]#appendFooterRow()#,
[methodname]#prependFooterRow()#, and [methodname]#addFooterRowAt()#.


[[components.grid.headerfooter.joining]]
=== Joining Header and Footer Cells

You can join two or more header or footer cells with the [methodname]#join()#
method. For header cells, the intention is usually to create column grouping,
while for footer cells, you typically calculate sums or averages.


[source, java]
----
// Group headers by joining the cells
HeaderRow groupingHeader = grid.prependHeaderRow();
HeaderCell namesCell = groupingHeader.join(
    groupingHeader.getCell("firstname"),
    groupingHeader.getCell("lastname")).setText("Person");
HeaderCell yearsCell = groupingHeader.join(
    groupingHeader.getCell("born"),
    groupingHeader.getCell("died"),
    groupingHeader.getCell("lived")).setText("Dates of Life");
----


[[components.grid.headerfooter.content]]
=== Text and HTML Content

You can set the header caption with [methodname]#setText()#, in which case any
HTML formatting characters are quoted to ensure security.


[source, java]
----
HeaderRow mainHeader = grid.getDefaultHeaderRow();
mainHeader.getCell("firstname").setText("First Name");
mainHeader.getCell("lastname").setText("Last Name");
mainHeader.getCell("born").setText("Born In");
mainHeader.getCell("died").setText("Died In");
mainHeader.getCell("lived").setText("Lived For");
----

To use raw HTML in the captions, you can use [methodname]#setHtml()#.


[source, java]
----
namesCell.setHtml("<b>Names</b>");
yearsCell.setHtml("<b>Years</b>");
----


[[components.grid.headerfooter.components]]
=== Components in Header or Footer

You can set a component in a header or footer cell with
[methodname]#setComponent()#. Often, this feature is used to allow filtering, as
described in <<components.grid.filtering>>, which also gives an example of the
use.



[[components.grid.filtering]]
== Filtering

The ability to include components in the grid header can be used to create
filters for the grid data. Filtering is done in the container data source, so
the container must be of type that implements
[interfacename]#Container.Filterable#.

[[figure.components.grid.filtering]]
.Filtering Grid
image::img/grid-filtering.png[width=50%, scaledwidth=80%]

The filtering illustrated in <<figure.components.grid.filtering>> can be created
as follows:


[source, java]
----
// Have a filterable container
IndexedContainer container = exampleDataSource();

// Create a grid bound to it
Grid grid = new Grid(container);
grid.setSelectionMode(SelectionMode.NONE);
grid.setWidth("500px");
grid.setHeight("300px");

// Create a header row to hold column filters
HeaderRow filterRow = grid.appendHeaderRow();

// Set up a filter for all columns
for (Object pid: grid.getContainerDataSource()
                     .getContainerPropertyIds()) {
    HeaderCell cell = filterRow.getCell(pid);

    // Have an input field to use for filter
    TextField filterField = new TextField();
    filterField.setColumns(8);

    // Update filter When the filter input is changed
    filterField.addTextChangeListener(change -> {
        // Can't modify filters so need to replace
        container.removeContainerFilters(pid);

        // (Re)create the filter if necessary
        if (! change.getText().isEmpty())
            container.addContainerFilter(
                new SimpleStringFilter(pid,
                    change.getText(), true, false));
    });
    cell.setComponent(filterField);
}
----


[[components.grid.sorting]]
== Sorting

A user can sort the data in a grid on a column by clicking the column header.
Clicking another time on the current sort column reverses the sort direction.
Clicking on other column headers while keeping the Shift key pressed adds a
secondary or more sort criteria.

[[figure.components.grid.sorting]]
.Sorting Grid on Multiple Columns
image::img/grid-sorting.png[width=50%, scaledwidth=75%]

Defining sort criteria programmatically can be done with the various
alternatives of the [methodname]#sort()# method. You can sort on a specific
column with [methodname]#sort(Object propertyId)#, which defaults to ascending
sorting order, or [methodname]#sort(Object propertyId, SortDirection
direction)#, which allows specifying the sort direction.


[source, java]
----
grid.sort("name", SortDirection.DESCENDING);
----

To sort on multiple columns, you need to use the fluid sort API with
[methodname]#sort(Sort)#, which allows chaining sorting rules. Sorting rules are
created with the static [methodname]#by()# method, which defines the primary
sort column, and [methodname]#then()#, which can be used to specify any
secondary sort columns. They default to ascending sort order, but the sort
direction can be given with an optional parameter.


[source, java]
----
// Sort first by city and then by name
grid.sort(Sort.by("city", SortDirection.ASCENDING)
              .then("name", SortDirection.DESCENDING));
----

The container data source must support sorting. At least, it must implement
[interfacename]#Container.Sortable#. Note that when using
[classname]#GeneratedPropertyContainer#, as described in
<<components.grid.generatedcolumns>>, even though the container implements the
interface, the wrapped container must also support it. Also, the generated
properties are not normally sortable, but require special handling to enable
sorting.


[[components.grid.editing]]
== Editing

Grid supports line-based editing, where double-clicking a row opens the row
editor. In the editor, the input fields can be edited, as well as navigated with
kbd:[Tab] and kbd:[Shift+Tab] keys. If validation fails, an error is displayed and the user
can correct the inputs.

To enable editing, you need to call [methodname]#setEditorEnabled(true)# for the
grid.


[source, java]
----
Grid grid = new Grid(GridExample.exampleDataSource());
grid.setEditorEnabled(true);
----

Grid supports two row editor modes - buffered and unbuffered. The default mode is
buffered. The mode can be changed with [methodname]#setBuffered(false)#

[[components.grid.editing.buffered]]
=== Buffered Mode

The editor has a [guibutton]#Save# button that commits
the data item to the container data source and closes the editor. The
[guibutton]#Cancel# button discards the changes and exits the editor.

A row under editing is illustrated in <<figure.components.grid.editing>>.

[[figure.components.grid.editing]]
.Editing a Grid Row
image::img/grid-editor-basic.png[width=50%, scaledwidth=75%]

[[components.grid.editing.unbuffered]]
=== Unbuffered Mode

The editor has no buttons and all changed data is committed directly
to the container. If another row is clicked, the editor for the current row is closed and
a row editor for the clicked row is opened.

[[components.grid.editing.fields]]
=== Editor Fields

The editor fields are by default generated with a [interfacename]#FieldFactory#
and bound to the container data source with a [classname]#FieldGroup#, which
also handles tasks such as validation, as explained later.

To disable editing in a particular column, you can call
[methodname]#setEditable()# in the [classname]#Column# object with
[parameter]#false# parameter.

[[components.grid.editing.editorfields]]
=== Customizing Editor Fields

The editor fields are normally created by the field factory of the editor's field
group, which creates the fields according to the data types of their respective
columns. To customize the editor fields of specific properties, such as to style
them or to set up validation, you can provide them with
[methodname]#setEditorField()# in the respective columns.

In the following example, we configure a field with validation and styling:


[source, java]
----
TextField nameEditor = new TextField();

// Custom CSS style
nameEditor.addStyleName("nameeditor");

// Custom validation
nameEditor.addValidator(new RegexpValidator(
    "^\\p{Alpha}+ \\p{Alpha}+$",
    "Need first and last name"));

grid.getColumn("name").setEditorField(nameEditor);
----

Setting an editor field to [parameter]#null# deletes the currently existing
editor field, whether it was automatically generated or set explicitly with the
setter. It will be regenerated with the factory the next time it is needed.


ifdef::web[]
[[components.grid.editing.captions]]
=== Customizing Editor Buttons

In the buffered mode, the editor has two buttons: [guibutton]#Save# and [guibutton]#Cancel#. You can
set their captions with [methodname]#setEditorSaveCaption()# and
[methodname]#setEditorCancelCaption()#, respectively.

In the following example, we demonstrate one way to translate the captions:


[source, java]
----
// Captions are stored in a resource bundle
ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(
    MyAppCaptions.class.getName(),
    Locale.forLanguageTag("fi")); // Finnish

// Localize the editor button captions
grid.setEditorSaveCaption(
    bundle.getString(MyAppCaptions.SaveKey));
grid.setEditorCancelCaption(
    bundle.getString(MyAppCaptions.CancelKey));
----

endif::web[]

[[components.grid.editing.fieldgroup]]
=== Binding to Data with a Field Group

Data binding to the item under editing is handled with a
[classname]#FieldGroup#, which you need to set with
[methodname]#setEditorFieldGroup#. This is mostly useful when using
special-purpose field groups, such as [classname]#BeanFieldGroup# to enable bean
validation.

For example, assuming that we want to enable bean validation for a bean such as
the following:


[source, java]
----
public class Person implements Serializable {
    @NotNull
    @Size(min=2, max=10)
    private String name;

    @Min(1)
    @Max(130)
    private int age;
    ...]
----

We can now use a [classname]#BeanFieldGroup# in the [classname]#Grid# as
follows:


[source, java]
----
Grid grid = new Grid(exampleBeanDataSource());
grid.setColumnOrder("name", "age");
grid.setEditorEnabled(true);

// Enable bean validation for the data
grid.setEditorFieldGroup(
    new BeanFieldGroup<Person>(Person.class));

// Have some extra validation in a field
TextField nameEditor = new TextField();
nameEditor.addValidator(new RegexpValidator(
    "^\\p{Alpha}+ \\p{Alpha}+$",
    "Need first and last name"));
grid.setEditorField("name", nameEditor);
----

To use bean validation as in the example above, you need to include an
implementation of the Bean Validation API in the classpath, as described in
<<dummy/../../../framework/datamodel/datamodel-itembinding#datamodel.itembinding.beanvalidation,"Bean
Validation">>.


ifdef::web[]
[[components.grid.editing.validation]]
=== Handling Validation Errors

The input fields are validated when the value is updated. The default
error handler displays error indicators in the invalid fields, as well as the
first error in the editor.

[[figure.components.grid.errors]]
.Editing a Grid Row
image::img/grid-editor-errors.png[width=50%, scaledwidth=75%]

You can modify the error handling by implementing a custom
[interfacename]#EditorErrorHandler# or by extending the
[classname]#DefaultEditorErrorHandler#.

endif::web[]

[[components.grid.editing.fieldfactory]]
=== Editor Field Factory

The fields are generated by the [classname]#FieldFactory# of the field group;
you can also set it with [methodname]#setEditorFieldFactory()#. Alternatively,
you can create the editor fields explicitly with [methodname]#setEditorField()#.

[[components.grid.scrolling]]
== Programmatic Scrolling

You can scroll to first item with [methodname]#scrollToStart()#, to end with
[methodname]#scrollToEnd()#, or to a specific row with [methodname]#scrollTo()#.


[[components.grid.stylegeneration]]
== Generating Row or Cell Styles

You can style entire rows with a [interfacename]#RowStyleGenerator# or
individual cells with a [interfacename]#CellStyleGenerator#.

[[components.grid.stylegeneration.row]]
=== Generating Row Styles

You set a [interfacename]#RowStyleGenerator# to a grid with
[methodname]#setRowStyleGenerator()#. The [methodname]#getStyle()# method gets a
[classname]#RowReference#, which contains various information about the row and
a reference to the grid, and should return a style name or [parameter]#null# if
no style is generated.

For example, to add a style names to rows having certain values in one column,
you can style them as follows:


[source, java]
----
grid.setRowStyleGenerator(rowRef -> {// Java 8
    if (! ((Boolean) rowRef.getItem()
                           .getItemProperty("alive")
                           .getValue()).booleanValue())
        return "grayed";
    else
        return null;
});
----

You could then style the rows with CSS as follows:


[source, css]
----
.v-grid-row.grayed {
    color: gray;
}
----


[[components.grid.stylegeneration.cell]]
=== Generating Cell Styles

You set a [interfacename]#CellStyleGenerator# to a grid with
[methodname]#setCellStyleGenerator()#. The [methodname]#getStyle()# method gets
a [classname]#CellReference#, which contains various information about the cell
and a reference to the grid, and should return a style name or [parameter]#null#
if no style is generated.

For example, to add a style name to a specific column, you can match on the
property ID of the column as follows:


[source, java]
----
grid.setCellStyleGenerator(cellRef -> // Java 8
    "born".equals(cellRef.getPropertyId())?
        "rightalign" : null);
----

You could then style the cells with a CSS rule as follows:


[source, css]
----
.v-grid-cell.rightalign {
    text-align: right;
}
----



[[components.grid.css]]
== Styling with CSS


[source, css]
----
.v-grid {
  .v-grid-scroller, .v-grid-scroller-horizontal { }
  .v-grid-tablewrapper {
    .v-grid-header {

        .v-grid-cell, .frozen, .v-grid-cell-focused { }
      }
    }
    .v-grid-body {
      .v-grid-row,
      .v-grid-row-stripe,
      .v-grid-row-has-data {
        .v-grid-cell, .frozen, .v-grid-cell-focused { }
      }
    }
    .v-grid-footer {
      .v-grid-row {
        .v-grid-cell, .frozen, .v-grid-cell-focused { }
      }
    }
  }
  .v-grid-header-deco { }
  .v-grid-footer-deco { }
  .v-grid-horizontal-scrollbar-deco { }
  .v-grid-editor {
    .v-grid-editor-cells { }
    .v-grid-editor-footer {
      .v-grid-editor-message { }
      .v-grid-editor-buttons {
        .v-grid-editor-save { }
        .v-grid-editor-cancel { }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

A [classname]#Grid# has an overall [literal]#++v-grid++# style. The actual grid
has three parts: a header, a body, and a footer. The scrollbar is a custom
element with [literal]#++v-grid-scroller++# style. In addition, there are some
decoration elements.

Grid cells, whether thay are in the header, body, or footer, have a basic
[literal]#++v-grid-cell++# style. Cells in a frozen column additionally have a
[literal]#++frozen++# style. Rows have [literal]#++v-grid-row++# style, and
every other row has additionally a [literal]#++v-grid-row-stripe++# style.

The focused row has additionally [literal]#++v-grid-row-focused++# style and
focused cell [literal]#++v-grid-cell-focused++#. By default, cell focus is
visible, with the border stylable with [parameter]#$v-grid-cell-focused-border#
parameter in Sass. Row focus has no visible styling, but can be made visible
with the [parameter]#$v-grid-row-focused-background-color# parameter or with a
custom style rule.

In editing mode, a [literal]#++v-grid-editor++# overlay is placed on the row
under editing. In addition to the editor field cells, it has an error message
element, as well as the buttons.
