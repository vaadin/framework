/**
 * DragSource is a {@link Component} that builds a {@link Transferable} for a

 * <p>
 * In Vaadin the drag and drop operation practically starts from client side
 * component. The client side component initially defines the data that will be
 * present in {@link Transferable} object on server side. If the server side
 * counterpart of the component implements this interface, terminal
 * implementation lets it create the {@link Transferable} instance from the raw
 * client side "seed data". This way server side implementation may translate or
 * extend the data that will be available for {@link DropHandler}.
