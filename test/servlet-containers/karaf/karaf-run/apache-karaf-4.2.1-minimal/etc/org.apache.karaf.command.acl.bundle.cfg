# This configuration file defines the ACLs for commands in the bundle subshell
#
# For an explanation of the syntax of this file, see the file:
#   org.apache.karaf.command.acl.system.cfg
#
# This configuration relies on the fact that 'system' bundles need to be managed
# with the
#   -f (--force)
# flag. Operations with -f need admin permission. Most of these operations without
# the 'force' option can be done by a manager.
