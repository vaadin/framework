/**
 * <p>
 * Defines the interface to commit and discard changes to an object, supporting
 * buffering.
 *
 * <p>
 * In <i>buffered</i> mode the initial value is read from the data source and
 * then buffered. Any subsequential writes or reads will be done on the buffered
 * value. Calling {@link #commit()} will write the buffered value to the data
 * source while calling {@link #discard()} while discard the buffered value and
 * re-read the value from the data source.
 *
 * <p>
 * In <i>non-buffered</i> mode the value is always read directly from the data
 * source. Any write is done directly to the data source with no buffering in
 * between. Reads are also done directly from the data source. Calling
 * {@link #commit()} or {@link #discard()} in this mode is efficiently a no-op.
 *
