# Vaadin Framework

This repository contains source code and issue tracking for Vaadin 8 and Vaadin 7, both of which use GWT as the base of client-side implementations. You can find source code and issue tracking for newer, web component based Vaadin versions in [vaadin/platform](https://github.com/vaadin/platform).

Vaadin 8 includes Vaadin 7 compatibility classes. The source code in this repository is (and will always be) available under Apache License 2.0, but Vaadin Framework 7 and 8 are now being maintained under a closed-source model by the Vaadin Expertise Team. You are free to continue using Vaadin Framework releases up to [8.14.3](https://github.com/vaadin/framework/releases/tag/8.14.3) and [7.7.17](https://github.com/vaadin/framework/releases/tag/7.7.17), and you are free to fork and maintain the framework yourself.
